## Abstract

We firmly believe that in the domain of 3D large models, the accumulation of data and creation of content through rapid iteration using appropriate tools, akin to the process in the text and image domains, is the only path to achieving a scale comparable to that of text or image-based large models. To this end, we have developed an interactive texture generation tool based on Blender. By collecting feedback data generated during human interaction with 3D models, we can better align human perception with digital assets, thereby laying the foundation for training large-scale models.
