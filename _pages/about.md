I’m a third-year graduate student from School of AI, University of Chinese Acdemic of Sciences (UCAS). My research interest includes 3D computer vision, Machine learning, Computer graphics and 3D.Generative Models.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianwei Guo](https://jianweiguo.net/) and [Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhangxiaopeng?language=en) of [NLPR Lab](https://nlpr-web.ia.ac.cn/en/) from Institute of Automation，Chinese Academy of Sciences. NLPR Lab now has been merged into [MAIS Lab](https://mais.ia.ac.cn/)

You can find my CV here: [Li Huibin’s Curriculum Vitae](../assets/cv/cv.pdf).

I’m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Phd’s degree starting from Winter and Fall 2025.
